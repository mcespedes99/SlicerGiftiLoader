# SlicerHippunfold

This extension loads gifti files to 3D Slicer and save them as vtk files in a specified folder. Multiple scalars can be attached to each mesh along with a color table as tsv file (which is optional). All of the information, except for the color table, for each mesh is saved into a new vtk file, which can be reloaded to 3D Slicer.

This tool was originally developed to import HippUnfold surfaces and volumes to 3D Slicer; however, it is able to load any other file with similar format.
